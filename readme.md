## background: proxy used to connect to github in China is not stable

> Before: 1. fork repo ---> 2. clone the fork repo ---> 3. edit local

> Next: 1. work on local branch (not master) ---> 2. go to origin/branch (web), click to fetch upstream [keep update with the (be forked repo)/master] ---> 3. push to origin/branch ---> 4. pull request
